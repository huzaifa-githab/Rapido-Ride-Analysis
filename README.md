# Rapido Ride Demand & Revenue Optimization Analysis

## Background
Urban ride-hailing platforms (bike, auto, cab, parcel) operate across multiple locations and time periods where demand, cancellations, and revenue vary significantly. Understanding when, where, and which services perform best is essential for improving operational efficiency, pricing strategy, and customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Rapido requires a data-driven analysis to identify:

- Which service categories generate the highest revenue and demand
- Peak hours and peak days of ride demand
- Locations with high ride volume and cancellation rates
- Customer payment behavior patterns
- Operational inefficiencies affecting ride completion

Currently, decision-making lacks consolidated insights across demand, revenue, and service performance.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze ride-level data to:

1. Identify demand patterns across time (hour, day, month)
2. Evaluate service-wise performance (Bike, Auto, Cab, Parcel)
3. Measure revenue drivers and revenue per ride
4. Detect cancellation trends and potential operational issues
5. Provide actionable recommendations for pricing, allocation, and service optimization

## Key Business Questions
This project aims to answer:

1. Which service category contributes the highest revenue?
2. What are the peak ride demand hours and days?
3. Which locations generate the most rides?
4. What is the cancellation rate and where is it highest?
5. How do distance and duration influence fare amount?
6. Which payment methods are most preferred by customers?

## Final Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset
- SQL business queries
- Power BI executive dashboard
- Business insight report with recommendations
- GitHub-published end-to-end analytics project
